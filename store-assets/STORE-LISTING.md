## Detailed Description

### ClearChat — Ad-Free ChatGPT Experience

ChatGPT now shows sponsored ads in your conversations. ClearChat removes them instantly.

**What it does:**
ClearChat is a lightweight browser extension that detects and removes sponsored content blocks from ChatGPT, giving you back the clean, distraction-free AI experience you signed up for.

**Key Features:**
• Smart 3-layer ad detection (DOM analysis + text matching + product card patterns)
• Real-time blocking via MutationObserver — ads are caught before you see them
• Beautiful stats dashboard showing ads blocked today, this session, and over 7 days
• Light & Dark mode following your system theme
• One-click toggle to pause/resume protection
• Auto-updating detection patterns — adapts to changes without extension updates

**Privacy First:**
• Zero data collection — nothing leaves your browser
• No external server connections
• All statistics stored locally on your device
• Fully open source on GitHub

**How it works:**
1. Install ClearChat from Chrome Web Store
2. Visit chat.openai.com or chatgpt.com
3. Ads are automatically removed — see the badge counter for proof

**Permissions explained:**
• "storage" — Saves your preferences and blocked ad statistics locally
• "activeTab" — Needed to detect and remove ads on ChatGPT pages
• Host access to chat.openai.com / chatgpt.com — Only runs on ChatGPT, nowhere else
